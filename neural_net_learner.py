def read_data(filename):

	See http://www.pybrain.org/docs/api/datasets/classificationdataset.html

	Reads a (naive) csv file of data and converts it into
	a ClassificationDataSet. 'Naive' in this case means
	the data can be parsed by splitting on commas - i.e.,
	no quotations or escapes. I picked this file format
	because it should be trivial to convert all our data into it.

	Raises an exception when an IO error occurs.

	Parameters:
	  filename - The name of the file containing the data.
